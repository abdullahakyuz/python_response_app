# Python Response App

This project is a standardized response library for APIs built with Python. It helps to manage API responses in a consistent format, making it easier to work with various web frameworks like Flask. This guide includes steps to containerize, deploy, and monitor the app using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform.
